        We may not know which way to go<br>
        On this dark road<br>
        (Mr. Duckworth)<br>
        All of these hoes make it difficult<br>
        Session ten, breakthrough<br>
        One of these lives, I'ma make things right<br>
        With the wrongs I've done, that's one of you now<br>
        With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight<br>
        Rain on me, put the blame on me<br>
        Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me<br>
        Got six magazines that's aimed at me<br>
        Done every magazine, what's fame to me? (And I'm trippin' and fallin')<br>
        It's a game to me, where the bedroom at?<br>
        Sleep, I ain't had affairs with that<br>
        What's fair when the hearts and the words don't reach?<br>
        What's fair when the money don't take things back?<br>
        It's rare when somebody take your dreams back? (And I'm trippin' and fallin')<br>
        I care too much, wanna share too much<br>
        In my head too much, I shut down too<br>
        I ain't there too much, I'm a complex soul<br>
        They layered me up, then broke me down<br>
        And moralities dust, I lack in trust (and I'm trippin' and fallin')<br>
        This time around, I trust myself<br>
        Please everybody else but myself<br>
        All else fails, I was myself<br>
        Out done fear, out done myself<br>
        This year, you better one yourself (and I'm trippin' and fallin')<br>
        Masks on the babies, mask on an opp<br>
        Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shot<br>
        But a mask won't hide who you are inside<br>
        Look around, the realities carved in the lies<br>
        Wipe my ego, dodge my pride (and I'm trippin' and fallin')<br>
        Look myself in the mirror<br>
        Amityville, I ain't seen nothin' scarier<br>
        I fought like a pit bull terrier, blood I shed could fill up aquariums<br>
        Tell my angels, "Carry 'em" (and I'm trippin' and fallin')<br>
        Every emotion been deprived<br>
        Even my strong points couldn't survive<br>
        If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg<br>
        I love when you count me out (huh)<br>
        I love when you count me out<br>
        I love when you count me out (wah, woo, ooh)<br>
        I love when you count me out<br>
        Fuck it up, fuck it up<br>
        Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up<br>
        How you gon' win my trust when the lies run deep? (Wah, woo, wah)<br>
        How you gon' bend your love when the bad don't sleep? (Sheeesh)<br>
        Beep, beep, crash our feelings in the middle of the street (vroom, vroom)<br>
        Fuck it up, fuck it up<br>
        Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (huh, huh)<br>
        When you was at your lowest, tell me where the hoes was at?<br>
        When you was at your lowest, tell me where the bros was at?<br>
        Three-thirty in the mornin', scroll through the call log (huh, huh, huh, huh)<br>
        Ain't nobody but the mirror lookin' for the fall off (Brrt)<br>
        I love when you count me out<br>
        I love when you count me out<br>
        I love when you count me out<br>
        I love when you count me out (wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)<br>
        My name is in your mouth, shoo, shoo<br>
        It's gon' take more than pride to stop<br>
        Call 9-1-1, I caught a body<br>
        Sun up now, yesterday is fadin'<br>
        Healing's only 'bout a mile away<br>
        Let me tell you 'bout the women I know (that's my baby)<br>
        I know karma like to follow us strong (sheesh)<br>
        I know millionaires that feel alone (sheesh)<br>
        Anytime I couldn't find God, I still could find myself through a song<br>
        Many find they life in a phone<br>
        Fuck it up, fuck it up<br>
        Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up<br>
        You said I'd feel better if I just work hard without liftin' my head up<br>
        That left me fed up<br>
        You made me worry, I wanted my best version but you ignored me<br>
        Then changed the story<br>
        Then changed the story<br>
        Good energy in the room, drop the location, please<br>
        Antibiotic for the womb, when I'm frustrated, please<br>
        (Antibiotic for the womb, when I'm frustrated)<br>
        Tryna keep my good conscious in rotation<br>
        Thoughts in my head, they livin' there with no- (tryna keep my good)<br>
        I made a decision, never give you my feelings<br>
        Fuck with you from, fuck with you from a distance<br>
        Some put it on the Devil when they fall short<br>
        I put it on my ego, lord of all lords<br>
        Sometimes I fall for her, dawg<br>
        I love when you count me out<br>
        I love when you count me out (sheesh)<br>
        I love when you count me out (sheesh)<br>
        I love when you count me out<br>
        My name is in your mouth<br>
        Fuck it up, fuck it up (true, true)<br>
        Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up<br>
        Miss Regrets, I believe that you done me wrong (Miss Regrets)<br>
        Miss Regrets, can you please exit out my home? (Miss Regrets)<br>
        Miss Regret, I think I'm better off alone (Miss Regrets)<br>
        (Miss Regret)<br>
        Miss Regret, I got these deep regrets (and I'm trippin' and fallin')<br>
        Some things I can't forget<br>
        Lord knows, I've tried my best<br>
        You said it's not my best<br>
        I came up out my flesh<br>
        Some things I must confess (ayy, ayy) (and I'm trippin' and fallin')<br>
        Spoke my truth, paid my debt (ayy, ayy)<br>
        Can't you see I'ma wreck? (Ayy, ayy)<br>
        Let me loose, I digress (ayy, ayy)<br>
