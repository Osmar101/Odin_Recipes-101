    <div style="max-width:700px; margin:auto;">

        Angels on the sideline <br>
        Puzzled and amused <br>\
        Why did Father give these humans free will? <br>
        Now they're all confused <br>
        Don't these talking monkeys know that <br>
        Eden has enough to go around? <br>
        Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys <br>
        Where there's one, you're bound to divide it <br>
        Right in two <br>
        Angels on the sideline <br>
        Baffled and confused <br>
        Father blessed them all with reason <br>
        And this is what they choose? <br>
        Monkey killing, monkey killing, monkey over <br>
        Pieces of the ground <br>
        Silly monkeys <br>
        Give them thumbs, they forge a blade <br>
        And where there's one, they're bound to divide it <br>
        Right in two <br>
        Right in two <br>
        Monkey killing, monkey killing monkey over <br>
        Pieces of the ground <br>
        Silly monkeys <br>
        Give them thumbs, they make a club <br>
        To beat their brother down <br>
        How they've survived so misguided is a mystery <br>
        Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability <br>
        To lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here <br>
        Gotta divide it all right in two <br>
        Gotta divide it all right in two <br>
        Gotta divide it all right in two <br>
        Gotta divide it all right in two <br>
        Fight till they die over sun, over sky <br>
        They fight till they die over sea, over air <br>
        They fight till they die over blood, over love <br>
        They fight till they die over words, polarizing <br>
        Angels on the sideline again <br>
        Benched along with patience and reason <br>
        Angels on the sideline again <br>
        Wondering where this tug of war will end <br>
        Gotta divide it all right in two <br>
        Gotta divide it all right in two <br>
        Gotta divide it all right in two <br>
        Right in two <br>
        Right in two <br>
